**IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION**-
ðŸ’® Isis flower has three species:-setosa,versicolor, and virginica, Which diffres according to their measurements. Now assume that you have the measurements of the iris flowers according to their species,and here your task is to train a machine learning model that can learn from the measurements of the iris species and classify them.

Although the Scikit-learn library provides a data set for iris flower classification, you can also download the same dataset from here for the task of iris flower classification with Machine Learning.
